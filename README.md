# softblocks
A visual representation of software which are built by assembling software components (blocks) idea for teaching software development to beginners and kids and is projected to eventually be the standard paradigm in software development in the near future. 

As a simple instance to have a software that models the solution to the quadratic equation:  

-b + âˆš(b^2 -4ac)/2a  

Blocks that model (addition, square-root,  subtraction, square, division and multiplication) are assembled (either by creating new ones or purchasing from a store). This is a simplified mapping of operators to blocks; real blocks are expected to be more complex and generally represent a function/method or a full-fledged object.

This will work simply by drag-n-dropping components that will fit together (output of one can fit into input connector of another or series of others). The input and output connectors are well defined by the types they return or accept.
